We were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening.  The ambiance is lovely.  We were greeted warmly initially, and the warmness continued throughout our visit.  As I said prior, the ambiance is lovely, the decor is SO just want to take it home.  The service was impeccable, our waitress was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and smiley.  OMG. The food.  THE FOOD!!!!  We had their summer special .  Holy COW, were they fantastic!  Entrees were   seafood shrimp Alfredo and our friend and I had the steak.

We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good. I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the SAME steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out. The food is great and a third of the price. I will NEVER go back and I will be telling everyone I know how this place has slipped and is horrible.

Tony's is located in Downtown Alton, which is a quiet little town on the Mississippi, about 30 minutes from St Louis. If you want a piece of history, you can get it here. Being in business since 1954, their dining room will draw you in with it's deep colored walls, pressed tin ceiling, and the amber Tiffany lamps adding the perfect glow over the cozy private booths.

A staple in Alton. Home wouldn't be the same without you. They actually just opened a second location in Jerseyville last week.

The kabob is a cheaper alternative that is just as tasty. If my memory serves me correct though you only get one side that way. \n\nTheir red sauce is really good. Its sweet which really hits my sweet teeth. Thats right, plural. \n\nThe house dressing is awesome, again, kind of sweet. The complimentary bread is really a decent piece of bread and not some cheap roll. They are really good at bringing you more to wipe up that dressing!\n\nNot sure if I've ever had their pizza warm. Cold it is very good. \n\nFunny story for ya. Came here for sophomore year homecoming. Jacki and I were not officially dating yet, but we went together and all the other guys were getting pepperloins and Jacki was really excited to order one, but I ordered first and got fettucini, so she did too... Learned years down the road. Looks like I have been saving up for my exodus out of this town for a while!

One of the guys also ordered a beer--from the list located on the wall.  The waitress comes back and first tells one guy- they are out of mushrooms, so he ordered another sandwich, the next guy was told they were out of the beer he ordered, and finally, the guy who ordered pizza was told, they were out of hamburger, so they could not make him the pizza with that topping!

We were in the bar area which is referred to as Tony's Third Street Cafe. The bar has a more casual and relaxed dining atmosphere and the wait staff makes your experience fun. \n\nThere were three couples and a single in attendance and everyone raved about their food. Alex the single diner, ordered the Cheeseburger pizza and had them hold the mustard.  It was so tasty, it actually tasted like a big meaty burger. I may have to order that one on our next visit to Tony's. I didn't pay close enough attention to what the other couples ordered, but I can tell you what we had; Onion Rings, Large Caesar Salad and Tony's Special Deluxe Pizza. \n\nThe onion rings were big thick slices and evenly breaded. I can see these being a perfect accompaniment to a \"real\" cheeseburger. Our large Caesar was definitely enough for two to share, or it could be a \"meal\" for a person watching the weight. \nI enjoyed the salad, but for my personal taste I like my Caesar dressing to have more of an anchovy bite to it. \n\nOur pizza was flawless! Tony's offers two types of crust; thin and thick and they should not be confused with the traditional types. Tony's thin crust is more like a flat bread and his thick is the bastard child of traditional and thin crust pizza. What that means is; the crust of the pie part is more like a traditional thin and the edges is like a traditional hand tossed pizza. I wish other pizza parlors offered this type of crust, because it gives you the best of both. \n\nAnother thing that makes Tony's pizza stand out from others, is his sauce. As stated by James M. it has a little \"sweet\" twang to it. When it is combined with all the toppings on my Special Deluxe it made things pop. That sweet sauce covered in meats, onions, green pepper and black olives was a true heavenly delight.  If a picture paints a thousand words, the one I posted of my pizza is worth thousand calories. \n\nOur server was a blast, she knew it was a holiday celebration (gift exchanging made it obvious) and she made sure we were well taken care of.

I would have also been disappointed by the tiny serving ($17.99 a plate) but I could certainly not stomach more than what was given to me. \n\nAs for the other dishes, I heard nothing but NEGATIVE comments (one dining companion even imitated what Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares might say, it was hilarious but ANYTHING BUT complimentary), aside from the RAVIOLI apparently being fantastic, but if that's the only item that's good on this huge menu, it's definitely not worth trying out. \n\nThe reason for the 2 star rating is because I came to this restaurant with a party of 15, half under the age of ten, and we only had ONE SERVER who never once got flustered or annoyed by our crazy commotion! \n\nClearly his cup of tea is dealing with large parties at Tony's... Someone fill up his mug... That is...

We went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend.  It was a Friday evening and we didn't have reservations so I was prepared for a wait. I was shocked when the host said it would only be 10-15 minutes. My husband and I stood up front for a few minutes until another hostess asked us to wait at the bar \"at the end of the hall\". \n\nWe strolled down the hallway past a good number of banquet rooms and finally found the bar through an old swinging door. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes and finally decided to have a glass of wine.  The wine list is mediocre at best.  My husband went to the bar to order and the bartender had no idea which wine on the list he requested.  The bartender's quote was \"all I know about wine is red or white\". A waiter finally showed him where the bottles were.  After another 15 minutes, we wandered back up front to check on our table.  The host remembered us and said we were next.  We were seated in a cavernous booth after about a 35 minute wait.  \n\nOur waiter came over and seemed immediately disappointed that we already had drinks.  He walked away and came back 15 minutes later to take our orders. I requested a glass of water at that point.  We both ordered pasta entrees and salads.  I got my water pretty quickly and our entrees were close behind.  We then asked about our salads that we hadn't received.  The waiter appeared pretty embarrassed and proceeded to tell us that he was so busy he was sweating and that if we wanted drinks to order now because the table next to us had been waiting about 20 minutes for another round of beers.\n\nThe food itself was okay. It was filling and the portions were well-sized, but not something worth a trip back over to Alton.

He never told us that our sides were extra that was separately charged he led us to believe that the salad was offered with the entree until we got our check and realized that it was extra.

Sat in a room off the bar area. Smelled like urine and bathroom air freshener. So powerful abt to gag. Order stuffed mushrooms that tasted freezer burned and pepperloin and pizza. Pizza sauce was sweeter than Chuckee Cheeses disgusting. And pepperloin was as dry as sawdust even with garlic butter. I am done with this place never again. Only went cause I was reliving the old days asking myself it couldn't have changed that much....YES it can and has. This place has gone so far downhill it's not even funny. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good. I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the same steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out. The food is great and a third of the price. I will NEVER go back and I will be telling everyone I know how this place has slipped and is horrible.

When we arrived we were told our wait would be 20 min.  At 30 min I asked how much longer.  We were finally taken to our table 45 min after we arrived.\n\nWhile waiting for our table in the small entry way, we noticed multiple occasions where the hostess desk was left unattended for 5-10 min at a time.  During these times the small entry area filled up with patrons waiting to be welcomed.\n\nWhen we finally reached our table our waiter came by within a few minutes, took our drink order (all water) and 10 min later they arrived.  At that point the waiter left our table to take care of other tables.  In his absence another wait person came by and told us about the evenings specials and said our waiter would be with us soon that he was running behind. Another 5-10 mins later the second wait person returned and said they would be taking care of our table.  They took our order and after it was requested, brought bread.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of Fried Artichoke Hearts.  Rather than receiving the entire heart, we received overly fried artichoke heart quarters.  Pathetic....not nearly worth the $8 we were charged.\n\nWhen the food arrived it was disappointing.  The kids food was acceptable.  They had a burger and salad.  My friend had the Teriaki Chicken Kabob and I had the Garlic Chicken.  When my friends dish arrived all that was on the plate was the kabob....no side, no garnish, no nothing.  Definitely not restaurant quality presentation. She commented the taste was ok, but nothing special or worth the long wait.  My garlic chicken was advertised as being pungent, which to my mind meant you'd really taste the garlic.  Not so.  A tasteless, almost overflowing amount of chicken and pasta was served in a bowl that was too small for the portion.  The dish was supposed to have onions, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, chicken and garlic over linguine pasta.  I got lots of pasta, plenty of mushrooms, scarce amounts of onions, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  There was some garlic  but not anywhere near pungent. They also served a slice of garlic bread that was so hard it was inedible.  I was totally disappointed in this meal.\n\nDue to the extremely long wait time for a table, the mediocre service, the poor food quality and the general lack of hospitality I will not be returning to Tony's.
